data structures are the logical basis for organising info on a computer, is comprised of primitive data types and rules. In other terms its a systematic way of organising and accessing data, even shopping lists count. 

data structures can be:
* homogenous(similar) or heterogeneous(unique)
* built in or DIY
* static or dynamic
* sequential, linked, or non-linear
==
single and double linked linear lists are examples

a stack is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to "last in first out" principle

Queues, first in first out. There is also priority queues, removal in order of priority


non linear lists: trees, graphs, 

======================================================
Algorithms are specifically specified procedures for performing a computational task. Independent from computer languages

5 features of an algorithm

finiteness - must end after finite steps
definiteness - must be clear, specific
input- specified 0 or more inputs
output - have a definite output
effectiveness -
